# Yelp-Campgrounds-Project
Yelp Camp Project, fullstack web app
## Link to the web app: https://sleepy-wave-96762.herokuapp.com/
> Fullstack project made using MongoDB, NodeJS and ExpressJS.
> New users can register by creating an account.
> Only logged in users can edit/delete their own campgrounds. Logged in users can add a new campground. They can add a review to other campgrounds.
> I have also used Mapbox API, to display the maps, i.e., each campground is at a particular location, and when a user views the campground, he can see the campground on the map. On the homepage the user can see a cluster map.
> I have used AWS S3 for uploading/deleting the campground images. Users can upload/delete images for their own campgrounds, as they wish. Maximum 5 images are allowed per campground.
> MongoDB Atlas is used as a database here.
> The database is seeded initially with 400 campgrounds, having random names, and random locations across The USA. The cities db file is in seeds/cities.js.
